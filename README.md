# Tindervator (not final)
### An app that is being developed for an evolving idea

#### Description

Tindervator is an app that will allow a person to make a very simple profile. By making a profile, they are making their profile publicly available to everyone on Tindervator (just like with Tinder). But instead of matching based on relationships, people will seek eachother out for the sake of finding desired skills for some project.

**For example:**
> Mark wants to make a social media app for fun. Mark is great at coding, but he absolutely sucks at UX design. So Mark goes onto Tindervator and searches for people who are skilled at UX Design. Mark knows that these people are motivated to work on his project because that's the reason they made a Tindervator account in the first place!

> Sally is a UX designer. But she is sick of designing websites that are never fully realized. Sally makes an account on Tindervator, hoping she can find some *real* project to work on. Suddenly, Sally gets a notification from a programmer named Mark: "Hey, Sally! Your designs are dope! And so is my code! Let's work together on my dope project and together we'll make it even more dope!"

> A few months pass and Sally and Mark sell *Dopestagram* for 50 million dollars. WOW!!
